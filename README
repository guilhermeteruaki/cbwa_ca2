Where to Host a container

Docker is a popular containerization tool in DevOps. It runs your application inside a container, uses minimum resources, can be deployed faster, and it can scale quickly. (geekflare).

There are many industry options for hosting your containers online. For exemple Amazon ECS (Amazon Elastic COntainer Services), Google Kubernetes or even their own services Docker dotCloud. These industry giants are very reliable and they provide many features and support for the developer. They are great options for medium to larger applications.

For our App we are considering 10-50 AMU (Active Monthly User) which is not a big amount.

Since we will not be generating a large amount of trafic Kamatera`s present us with a good cost-benefit.
They provide services for as little as 4$/mo, although they may not have all the features of a industry giant, the have high-quality performance hardware, 24/7 phone support and a 30 day money back guarantee.
